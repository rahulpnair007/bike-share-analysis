# 1. Data Loading

```{r load-data}
# Set your working directory (adjust the path as needed)
# setwd("D:/Unni/Course_Materials/CaseStudy_1/Last_12_Months_Data")

# List and read all CSV files
file_list <- list.files(path = "D:/Unni/Course_Materials/CaseStudy_1/Last_12_Months_Data", pattern = "*.csv", full.names = TRUE)
bike_data <- file_list %>%
  map_df(read_csv)
```

# 2. Data Cleaning

```{r clean-data}
# View basic structure
str(bike_data)

# Clean column names
bike_data <- bike_data %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

# Create new columns
bike_data <- bike_data %>%
  mutate(started_at = ymd_hms(started_at),
         ended_at = ymd_hms(ended_at),
         ride_length = as.numeric(difftime(ended_at, started_at, units = "mins")),
         day_of_week = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(ride_length > 0)
```

# 3. Data Analysis

```{r analysis}
# Summary Statistics
summary(bike_data$ride_length)

# Ride counts by bike type
bike_data %>%
  group_by(rideable_type) %>%
  summarise(total_rides = n())

# Ride counts by day of week
bike_data %>%
  group_by(day_of_week) %>%
  summarise(total_rides = n())
```

# 4. Data Visualisation

```{r visualisation}
# 4.1 Ride Length Distribution
bike_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ride_length)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  xlim(0, 100) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Ride Lengths", x = "Ride Length (minutes)", y = "Number of Rides") +
  theme_minimal()

# 4.2 Rides by Bike Type
bike_data %>%
  group_by(rideable_type) %>%
  summarise(total_rides = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = rideable_type, y = total_rides, fill = rideable_type)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Number of Rides by Bike Type", x = "Bike Type", y = "Total Rides") +
  theme_minimal()

# 4.3 Rides by Day of Week
bike_data %>%
  group_by(day_of_week) %>%
  summarise(total_rides = n()) %>%
  mutate(day_of_week = factor(day_of_week, levels = c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = total_rides, fill = day_of_week)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Number of Rides by Weekday", x = "Day of the Week", y = "Total Rides") +
  theme_minimal()
```

# 5. Summary and Recommendations

```{r conclusion, echo=FALSE}
# Key Takeaways
cat("\n- Most rides are under 40 minutes.\n")
cat("- Classic bikes were the most popular ride type.\n")
cat("- Highest usage is observed during weekends.\n")
cat("- Recommend focusing on weekend promotions and optimising bike availability.")
